Hi, I’m Raheel and I am currently working as a Research Assistant in Paderborn University, Heinz Nixdorf Institute (HNI).
I have a great interest in this field of software development, software testing. As I always work on to improve my skills day in and day out. 

Life has always been a smooth flowing brook with small dashes here and there. It has certainly reached a critical juncture     when I have to desire where to turn and what to do next and my idea of life can be best quoted by this very famous quotation:

                 		“A Journey of a Thousand Miles Must Begin with a Single Step”

I believe secret of Success lies in Knowledge and Hard Work. “We live only once, but if we live right, once is enough” the same truth applies to one’s career decision because the career you choose is going to live with you throughout life.
